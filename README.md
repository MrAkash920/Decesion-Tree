# Decision Tree 

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive Decision Tree implementation for data analysis and predictive modeling. Decision Trees are powerful tools for classification and regression tasks, as they provide interpretable and intuitive insights into data patterns.

## Features

- **Flexible**: Supports both classification and regression tasks.
- **Pruning**: Implements pruning techniques to prevent overfitting.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure tree depth, splitting criteria, and more.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the generated tree structure.
- **Scalable**: Handles both small and large datasets efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the Decision Tree module, simply clone this repository or download the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree.git
```

### Usage

1. Import the `DecisionTree` class:

```python
from decision_tree import DecisionTree
```

2. Create a Decision Tree object:

```python
dt = DecisionTree()
```

3. Fit the model to your data:

```python
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

4. Make predictions:

```python
predictions = dt.predict(X_test)
```

### Customization

You can customize the Decision Tree behavior by specifying parameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and the splitting criterion.

```python
dt = DecisionTree(max_depth=5, min_samples_split=2, criterion='gini')
```

### Visualization

To visualize the generated tree structure, use the `plot_tree` method:

```python
dt.plot_tree()
```
